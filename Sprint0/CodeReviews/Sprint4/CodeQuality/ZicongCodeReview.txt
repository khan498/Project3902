The code stays in the range of high quality. The class is designed to be used as a physics engine that
passes into the mario class to manage the movement of mario. That being said, method body within the 
class follows a clean design pattern that has high cohesion and low coupling. Separating between walking
jumping makes the code easy to maintain. If I were to suggest any thing that could slightly make the code
even better, I would suggest that making this class available when mario is dead would be helpful, since 
the physics engine only updates while mario is alive, based on the fact that there will also be animation 
of dead mario
