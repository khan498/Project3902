	The code definitely stays within the range of good quality. The class is implemented so it can control and record the score in game. The class has 
	relatively low coupling, since for most of the method bodies the only two parameters that got passed in were the x and y values. The class follows
	a clean design where each socre from different part of game is managed separately and altered indiviually with reduced steps, which implies a low 
	coupling of the class. If I were to give any advice to make the class even better, I would say that DrawScore can be re-implemented so that it can 
	fall into the spritedrawer class, which makes the code easier to maintain and reuse.
