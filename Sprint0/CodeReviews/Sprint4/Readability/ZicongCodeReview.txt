	The Code is readable. First of all, the clss has a clean design, where the constructor is at the top,
	followed by different methods built within the class. Using the physics class as a parameter to control all 
	other behaviors of item inhance the cohesion of the class. If I were to give any suggestion on the class,
	adding variables that could be passed into the physics class could make the implementation more flexiable.
