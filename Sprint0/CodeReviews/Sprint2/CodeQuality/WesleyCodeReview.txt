File being reviewed: QuestionBlockSprite.cs
Author of the file: Zicong Zhang

	Overall, I believe that this file has good code quality. It has four
	fields but they are all relevent to what the class represents. Plus,
	one of the fields is static since it is the same between all instances
	of the class, reducing duplicate copies of data that doesn't change
	between instances. The methods have names that clearly describe what
	they do and take at most two parameters, reducing complexity.

	One hypothetical change to the game that this class wouldn't be very
	maintainable with would be if the QuestionBlockSprites were to be scaled
	up or down in size as the game was running. Since the class uses magic 
	number values for the width and height for the destination rectangle, they 
	couldn't be changed while the game was running. Doing so would require 
	stopping the game, editing the magic number values, and re-compiling.
