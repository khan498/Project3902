	I would consider the entire file readable. It uses obvious variable names and 
	separates the various parts of the file nicely. There is one way that I think
	the file could be even better, however, and that would be to fix the
	indentation levels of the methods. Currently, they are indented by eight
	spaces but four is the standard number to use.
