Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	As a computer science engineering major student with 2 months experience with C#,
	I think this code is readable because 
	first, its indentation and formatting are very clear.
	Second, The naming conventions are very clear to know the useage of each method.
	Third, there is no long method, each method is meaningful and short.
	Forth, he also included a comment on what to do next which is good for the other programmers.
	So over all, I think this code is good in readablity.
