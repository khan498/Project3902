	The code in this class is following good code quality propeties. It has fields that are relevent only to the specific tasks done by the methods,
	making them highly cohesive. There are also a low number of dependencies throughout the class, resulting is low coupling. A lot of the functionality
	is also hidden under the SpriteDrawer class, reducing complexity and making it more maintainable. Other than the draw method passing in magic numbers,
	the rest of the code is as maintainable as it gets.
