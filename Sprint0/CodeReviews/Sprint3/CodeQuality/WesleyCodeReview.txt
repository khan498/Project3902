I would say that the file StarMario.cs has low coupling and hight cohesion.
Therfore, I would also say that it has excellent code quality. In regards to
coupling, the StarMario class has only two dependencies, an IPlayer and an 
array of Colors. So, its coupling is very low. In regards to cohesion,
since there are only two fields, and they are both relevent to the function of
the class, cohesion is very high.

Looking at the methods, most of them are either zero lines due to them having
no operation or one line. The Draw method just calls the Draw method of the
IPlayer it is decorating and passes it a different parameter value, making the
method very simple and easy to maintain. The most complicated method is the
Update method but even then it uses obvious and descriptive variable names and
is overall easy to reason about.

One suggestion would be to change the field name for the IPlayer to something
like decoratedPlayer since concrete instances of IPlayer can potentially be
classes for different characters other than Mario. Adding a new character such
as Luigi would probably require the name of that field to be changed anyways
since referring to a Luigi object as starMario doesn't make much sense. On that
note, changing the name of the class to StarPlayer or something like that would
increase reusability in the same regard.
