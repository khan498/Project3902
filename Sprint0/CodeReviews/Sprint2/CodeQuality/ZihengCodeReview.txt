Name of the .cs file being reviewed:	Coin.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:	Tanzim Khan
Number of minutes taken to complete the review:	15 mins
Specific comments on code quality: 
	Code's cohesion is high and coupling is low so it follows high code quality desgin pattern
	There is no code smells since every method is not long and the class is meaningful
	The design of this class is clear. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	It is easy to change if we want the coin to be in different sprite or change its location
	we only need to change the parameters we give to this class.
