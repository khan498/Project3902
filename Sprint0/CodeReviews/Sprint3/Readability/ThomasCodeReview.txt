	This code is highly readable, especially considering the complexity of this class.  The variable names clearly
	indicate what they describe and the program flow follows a logical pattern.  This class basically iterates through lists 
	of each type of game entity looking for places where the edges of the entities overlap with each other.  When one of them
	shows an overlap, it calls an external method to handle interaction between the two objects.  The four iteration blocks are
	all structured exactly the same, allowing for consistent readibility across the entire class.
