Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	I think this code is readable because 
	1. Its indentation and formatting are very clear.
	2. The naming conventions are very clear to know the useage of each method.
	3. There is no long method, each method is meaningful and short.
	4. It will be easy to change or adding new features for this class.
	So over all, I think this code is good in readablity.
