	The code is definitely within the range of good quality. First of all, the code is well organized that 
	the switch case help to determine the specific cases of collision, which is a sign of high cohesion.
	And the every variable used in the class is declared and initalized at the top of the class and used throughout
	the entire class. Then The code has low coupling in a way that there are few dependencies that the class rely on.
	If I were to give any suggestion to make the code even better, I would suggest that making specific cases for koopa 
	and goobo in terms of collision, since each of them will need different response for collision.
