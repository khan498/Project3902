Specific comments on code quality: 
	Code's cohesion is high and coupling is low so it follows high code quality desgin pattern
	For coupling, the MarioItemCollisionRespomder has only 3 dependencies. 
	There is no code smells since every method is not long and the class is meaningful
	most of the methods are only 3 or 2 lines length.
	The design of this class is clear. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	It is easy to change if we want to change the enemies' velocity. Just change the value of velocity.
