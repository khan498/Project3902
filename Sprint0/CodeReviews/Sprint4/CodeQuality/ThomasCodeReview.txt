This class follows a similar format to the other physics classes with methods to dictate the movement of the fireball.
It is highly cohesive since it only contains methods that deal directly with movement such as bounce, gravity, moveLeft 
and moveRight.  As for coupling, the only other class referenced is the fireball class.  Generally this class is loosely 
coupled since it doesn't have any other dependencies.  To improve the quality of this code and reduce redundancy among this
one with other similar physics classes, and abstract physcs class could be created to implement all the common methods.
