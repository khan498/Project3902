Burndown Chart Assesment:

	Sprint 2:

		Based on the burndown chart, there are definitely some things we could
		have done better as a team in regards to time management.
		Although we produced an end product for both the initial implementation
		and refactoring periods that was correct, most of the progress was made
		on the days each was due. In the future, it would be beneficial if we
		spread out the completion of tasks over a longer period of time as to
		avoid having to rush things at the last minute. For sprint 2 these
		last minute implementations were simple enough that a good quality
		product could be produced at the last minute but as we move on to more
		sprints, things will definitely get more complicated and therefore last
		minute implementations have a higher risk of being error prone.

	
	Sprint 3:

		The burndown chart for the this sprint has been improved quite a bit compared to sprint 2.
		There have been compartively lower number of tasks created mid-sprint, but there were some.
		These additional tasks resulted from poor planning at the begining and some unforscene changes
		during the middle of the sprint. However, we did get a mahority of the tasks done before the
		refactoring period, which equates to an overall steady pace of progress.


	Sprint 4:

		We were able to improve the burndown chart even further in this sprint. There was amost no additional
		tasks/hours that were added mid-sprint, which can be attributed to improvements made to the planning
		stage of the sprint. As for the work progression, it does not match the ideal pace line, since everyone 
		was working at their own pace. However all the tasks for the initial implementation and the refactoring 
		stage got completed within the deadline.


	Sprint 5:

		Simillar to the last sprint, there were no additional tasks added in the middle of the sprint due to
		efficient planning. However, the progress was a little slow compared to the previous sprints, and so we were 
		lagging being the ideal trend line. But all the tasks were completed before the deadlines, for both 
		initial implementation and the refactoring stage.

	Sprint 6:

		Simillar to the last few sprints the planning was done efficiently and no tasks were added mid sprint. 
		The chart however is lagging behind the ideal trend line, which is because of a late start due to the 
		holidays and also since there was no hard deadline for the innitial implementation stage. Regardless, we 
		were able to finish all of our tasks ahead of the deadline.
