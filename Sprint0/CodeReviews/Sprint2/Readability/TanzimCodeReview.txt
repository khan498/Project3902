	The code is definitely readable for the most part. It is properly formatted and follows the proper naming conventions for methods and variables.
	The code is written in a sequential manner, making it easy to track and understand what exactly it is doing.
	One thing that I could suggest is creating a custom wait logic for all animated sprites, since the current implementation of ticks
	is shared by all the sprite classes. This will improve the readability of the the Update() method even further.
