File being reviewed: GameScore.cs
Author of file: Thomas Unger

	This file deals with tracking the player's score during the course of the
	game. The name of the file, class, and the names of the fields all make it
	clear that this file deals with the player's score. All the field names
	have to deal with score values and how to display them. All the method
	names are clear in what they do and have at most one level of nested
	branching. Most of the methods have only two lines and even the ones with
	more are still easy to reason about. Considering all of this, this file
	has great code quality.

	One suggestion that I would make to improve this file even more would be
	to possibly abstract out the logic for detecting when to adjust the
	player's score into a class such as a ScoreManager. Then, GameScore would
	just be told when to add to it's score and how much to add it it by the
	ScoreManager. That way, all the logic for chain kills could also be taken
	out of GameScore.
