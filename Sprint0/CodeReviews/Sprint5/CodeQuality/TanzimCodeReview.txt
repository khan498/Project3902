	The code in this class is following good code quality propeties. It has fields that that are used in this class 
	and it only deals with activities related to the timer, which makes the class fairly cohesive. There are also a low 
	number of dependencies throughout the class, resulting is low coupling. It can be argued that since the class deals with
	changing game music and turning on the game over state, it lowers cohision. But then again, since these are
	events that trigger based on the timer exclusively, it can also be said that the cohesion isn't affected.
