This class includes a lot of new features that were added to the game in the final sprint.  The class is almost 270 lines long,
but besides being over the recommended line limit, it maintains high cohesion.  This class provides the interface between the 
controllers, levels, and game states associated with the new arena game mode.  The class has moderately tight coupling with the
controller and level classes but because it is a higher-level class whose main purpose is to facilitate communication between
other classes, this coupling is acceptable.  To improve the quality of this class, some of the methods that deal with specific 
groups of classes like controllers or the camera could be broken out into separate utility classes.  This would decrease the 
overall size of this file as well as decrease the overall coupling.
