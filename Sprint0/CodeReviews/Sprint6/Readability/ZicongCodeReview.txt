	The code is definitely readable. The class is used to generate start screen before the entering the game. Each
	method inside the class is well organized in a way that the code explains what it does by itself. For example, there 
	is initialize and selectoption, which labels the begin of middle of the process of generateing starting screen.
	The update and draw, as other functional classes, are responsible for the regular drawing and inputs. If there were one
	suggestion that I were to give to make the code even better, I would suggest that the initializations of option and other 
	stuff could be combined together, which makes the class even cleaner.
