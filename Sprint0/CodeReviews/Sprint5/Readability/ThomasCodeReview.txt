This class is generall pretty readable when it comes to understanding the functionality and the different components at work.
It basically controlls Mario's interaction with the two end of level environmental objects, the flag pole and the castle.  The 
Animate method takes up the majority of the file and dictates responses to a couple of different cases of Mario interacting with 
the flag pole.  To improve the readability of this class, consider restructuring the animate method to make the use of the boolean 
values shiftedRight and sidesSwitched more clear.
