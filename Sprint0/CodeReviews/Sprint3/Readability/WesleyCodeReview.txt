	This file is very readable. All of the field names for the class are
	descriptive enough to not require comments and related field names are
	grouped together. Any methods that do nothing have a comment stating that
	no operation is done for them and most of the methods are only one line.
	The only part of the file that is not as readable as the rest is the Update
	method but that's to be expected since implementing the changing of colors
	on the player's sprite is more complicated than the other methods. Overall, 
	I would say that the entire file is very readable.
