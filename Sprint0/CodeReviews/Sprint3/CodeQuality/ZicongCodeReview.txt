I would say that the code is within the range of high quality. Firstly, the class has 
high cohesion in which one important thing that the code does to the game is to put everything 
into the world. Other than the fact that the code itself is a detailed explanation of what
it is capable of, the use of switch cases between different types of objects provide low coupling 
side of the code. The class in general takes an input file, read the file, and then output the 
objects to the window based on differrent number of object Id, which can be also considered as 
an easy way of organize code. One suggestion I would made if there is any is that since we will
be dealing with a entire world that is times longer than the one we implemented for this sprint,
we could probably passes the id to different objects; so when we manipulate the objects around in
the game world, we could actually change the file directly through object coding, which outputs 
immediately to the window with the coresponding effect.
