	This file is defintely readable. The name of the class tells you what the
	class represents and it implements an interface that is easy to interpret
	as well. The file follows the proper formatting and style conventions that
	all the other files follow and all the method names are clear and as short
	as possible. One problem with the file, however, is that the method names
	could be improved if they were all verbs instead of some of them such as
	"EnemyStompScore". Other than that, the file is perfectly readable.
