	The first thing I noticed with this class is that there are still a number of lines commented out.  This indicates that the class is 
	probably still under development, but as of right now it is somewhat difficult for an outside observer to undestand what is going on.
	Basically, I've gathered that this class gets the player's current position in the world and moves the camera relative to that position.
	Generally, the methods have descriptive names but between the comments and the formatting, it's also hard to follow the syntax and 
	control flow.  To improve readibility, consider putting descriptive comments for methods outside the method body, removing old code that
	has been commented out, and spacing out the methods more so it's easier to see what code belongs to which one.
