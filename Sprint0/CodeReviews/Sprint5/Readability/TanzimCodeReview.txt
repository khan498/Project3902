	The code is formatted froperly and is readable for the most part. However there are some issues with it. First of all, a majority of the methods voilate
	the proper naming convention. The SoundFactory is class is also tracking keyboard states, and playing sounds based on those key presses. This should instead
	be handled by the commands that the controllers call. Additionaly, the sound factory has methods like Update, which go outside of the scope of what a 
	factory class should do, which in this case is only returning a sound effect.
