	The code in this class follows good code quality propeties for the most part. The class performs only a limited number of activities 
	(that deal with the movement of the star item), as well as the fields being used make of class highly cohesive. There are also a fairly 
	low number of dependencies throughout the class, resulting is low coupling. The only issues that I can point out are the following:
	
	1. The public boolean field "g" should be renamed appropriately, made private, and encapsulated in a public property.
	2. The method nameed "bounceUp" should be pascal case.
	3. There is no actual need for inheriting from an IPhysics interface since the all the concrete physics classes are being used directly 
		by their respective objects anyway.
