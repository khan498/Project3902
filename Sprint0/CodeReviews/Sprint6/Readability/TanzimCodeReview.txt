	The code is formatted froperly and is definitely readable. The variables and methods follow the proper naming convention
	and have simple and clear objectives. The methods, and the whole class in general, are short and only do what they are 
	supposed to. The only thing that I can add is that the assignment of enemy and item properties (for example item.IsActivated = true)
	can be moved outside of the if-else statements, since all those randomly generated objects share the same properties.
