This code in this class aligns with the standards of high quality.  It contains cohesive methods 
that only carry the minimum functionality to make this class unique.  The project was recently updated
to include a SpriteDrawer class that implements methods that were repeated in a variety of sprite classes.  
This class now calls those methods so the project has a unified way of drawing sprites regardless of the type.
This class is loosely coupled with the SpriteDrawer class since the SpriteDrawer class can be used for any sprite
in the project, animated or not.  

One possible change to make to this implementation would be to have it implement SpriteDrawer as an abstract class
or a singleton instead of a concrete class.  This would improve memory usage for the game since there would be less
instances of the SpriteDrawer class that all call the same methods.  The current implementation could support that 
change with some effort to update every sprite file in the game to account for the change.
