	This class exhibits many of the characteristics of high quality code, but also has some room for improvement.
	As a major class that directs the flow of the program for a large number of interactions, there is little way to
	decrease the complexity of the class.  It is approximately 250 lines long, most of which is taken up by conditional
	checks for the various types of collisions.  The class exhibits a high level of cohesion because it contains only the 
	methods necessary to handle the different types of collisions.  It has relatively high cyclomatic complexity and long 
	length but those issues are unavoidable for a class of this type.  This class also exhibits loose coupling with almost
	no outside dependencies.
