	The code is definitely readable. It is properly formatted and follows the proper naming conventions for methods and variables.
	It is also written in a sequential manner, making it easy to track and understand what exactly it is doing.
	The only suggestion that I can make would be related to the class's code quality. The mouse movement is implemented in this class,
	but it should be transfered to a mouse controller class and treated as a new controller (even if it's only for debugging purposes).
