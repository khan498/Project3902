File being reviewd: LuigiSpritePicker.cs

Time to complete code review: ~10min

The LuigiSpritePicker class is certainly readable. The class only implements
one method which is Update. The name of the Update method makes what the method
does immediately obvious. That and the class being very similar to the
MarioSpritePicker class makes it easy to see that the class just decides
which sprite Luigi should have depending on what his current state it. The part
of the file that isn't so readable is the branching logic. There is some
deep nesting inside the Update method but although there is a lot of logic,
the logic for each branch is relatively simple.
