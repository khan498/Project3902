Specific comments on code quality: 
	Code's cohesion is high and coupling is low so it follows high code quality desgin pattern
	For coupling, the methods have only 1 dependency. 
	There is no code smells since every method is not long and the class is meaningful
	most of the methods are not too long.
	The design of this class is clear. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	It is easy to add new other objects and change the chance that we can get the object by 
	changing the number
