This class maintains high readibility due to the way the functionality is broken up into its member functions.
The class dictates the behavior of the moving platforms in the arena game mode.  Each function of the platform 
is defined in a separate method which is called in sequence as part of the update method.  The initial parameters
of the platform such as size and velocity are defined near the top of the class in a location where they can be 
easily modified.  In addition, the variables have clear names to make tracking the function a simple task.
