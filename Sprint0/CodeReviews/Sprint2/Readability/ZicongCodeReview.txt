	The code has high readability in terms of formatting and clarity. The code is self explaining in a  way
	in which the process of mapping command into the controller mapper is divided into three steps, which are
	organized in a well manner.
	One thing I would suggest about the code would be adding a function in the controller class so that the controller 
	class is able to call and use implementions directly from the spritefactory and state machines, which will be an 
	important component in Sprint2.
