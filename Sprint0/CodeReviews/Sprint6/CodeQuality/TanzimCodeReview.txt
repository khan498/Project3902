	The code in this class is following good code quality propeties. The class uses a very limited number variables,
	and the classes have very specific functions, resulting it to be highly cohesive. Also it uses another collision
	class specific to FIreball collisions, resulting in a low cohession. The only thing that I can suggest is getting 
	rid of the dead/commented out code in the HandleCollision method (which was likelyput in there for testing purposes).
