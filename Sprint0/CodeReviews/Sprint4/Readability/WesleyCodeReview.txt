File being reviewed: EnemyEnemyCollisionResponder.cs
Author of the file: Ziheng Wei
Number of minutes to complete code review: ~10 minutes

	In general, the file is easy to read. It is structured like the other
	collision responder classes and therefore has a familiar layout and
	flow just like the others. The variable names are descriptive and
	therefore the code does not require comments. Therefore, I'd say that
	this file is readable.
