	The code overall stays in the range of high quality. First of all no addional comments need to be added to explain
	what the code is doing. Also the code has high cohesions in which every method is necessary and is implemented with 
	a clean design.
	A hypothetical change to the class would be using more organized designs or nested-class structure on command mapping 
	patterns, which, on the one hand, based on what the project's performance would be something that need lees consideration
	but would increase overall code qulity interms of clean design.
