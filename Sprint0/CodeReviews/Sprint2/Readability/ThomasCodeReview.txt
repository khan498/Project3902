	Overall this file is straightforward and readable.  It contains clear references to the rectangles 
	used to select sprites off the spritesheet as well as easy to understand logic that dictates the change 
	between frames.  One idea to make the code more uniform with the rest of the project would be to change 
	the ticks per frame references to a millisecond value so behavior remains predictable regardless of the 
	performance of the system.  This would also cause the code to follow the same convention as some of the 
	other animated sprites and input handling logic in the game.
