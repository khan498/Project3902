	The code is definitely readable. It is properly formatted and all the variables, properties and methods follow proper naming conventions.
	It is also written in a sequential manner, making it easy to track and understand what exactly it is doing.
	The methods names are named really nicely, as they perfectly explain wthat they are doing without needing any comments.
