Name of the .cs file being reviewed:	MarioItemCollisionResponder.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:	Tanzim Khan
Number of minutes taken to complete the review:	15 mins
Specific comments on code quality: 
	Code's cohesion is high and coupling is low so it follows high code quality desgin pattern
	For coupling, the MarioItemCollisionRespomder has only 3 dependencies. 
	There is no code smells since every method is not long and the class is meaningful
	most of the methods are only 3 or 2 lines length.
	The design of this class is clear. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	It is easy to change if we want to add more items and the class won't be changed a lot only add a new else if statement.
