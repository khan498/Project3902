	The file is highly readable. No comments are needed to explain what the
	code is doing. The design is clear and straightforward. In addtition, using
	an input text file with numbers as object identifiers to load objects in level
	is a relatively smart way of design. All objects are sorted into lists so that 
	they can be used in a switch logic to render the game objects. One suggestion 
	would be that if we were to implement more objects into the game, we could build 
	another class or function to actually organize stuff.
