	The overall class is totally readable. Using boolean to check whether Koopa is in shell 
	is definitely a good way of design , since the boolean can be used in the collsion responder 
	to set up the sound. if there were one thing I would suggest to make the code better is that
	Koopa could use a timer that causes him to go back to walking state after a short time period.
