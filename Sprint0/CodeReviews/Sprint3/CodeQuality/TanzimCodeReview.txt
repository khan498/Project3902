	The code in this class is following good code quality propeties. It has fields that that are used in this class make the class,
	fairly cohesive. There are also a fairly low number of dependencies throughout the class, resulting is low coupling. However, since
	the class is changing both mario's position and changing the block states, it can be argued that the class has low cohesion. But 
	since there are only a limited number of block types, and some have to be removec from the level, keeping them in the same class
	might result in low number of dependencies.
