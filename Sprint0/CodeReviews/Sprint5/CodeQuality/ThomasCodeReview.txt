This file is highly cohesive since it only performs the functions related to the level timer.  It fits within the size limit for classes
and does not have any nested branching or overly complicated methods.  This file's coupling is loose.  The only external dependencies are
to the soundFactory class, which is used for time-related sound effects.  Overall, the only code quality improvement that could be made to 
this class would be to save the 100 second time limit as a separate variable so that the file wouldn't contain any magic numbers.
